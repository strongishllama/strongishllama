# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Taliesin, a Site Reliability Engineer living on the [Sapphire Coast](https://www.sapphirecoast.com.au) of NSW Australia, currently working on the [Scalability::Observability Team](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/team/scalability/observability) at GitLab.

# Work Style

I value empathy, integrity and hard work, as long as you have a good attitude and try your best, we'll get along great!

I enjoy getting hands on with problems and playing around to figure out where the issue lies, sometimes I need to remind my self to take a step back and do some research before diving in.

# Communication

Due to having a young family, [asynchronous communication](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/company/culture/all-remote/asynchronous) works best for me most of the time. However, if you give me a bit of notice, I'm always happy for a face to face coffee chat.

For anything work related, you can email me at tmillhouse@gitlab.com. For anything else, here are a few places you can find [me](https://millhouse.dev/contact).

I try and be direct, kind and empathetic towards others. Leaving ego at the door and using language that is inclusive and easy to follow. When communicating with me if you feel I can improve on this in any way, or others, please let me know.

# Interests and Hobbies

I don't often get much time for hobbies these days, but when I do I like to paint miniatures, ride my bike, go diving/spearfishing or learn about and contribute to open source technologies in the DevOps/Platform space.
